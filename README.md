# Le Mini RPG

Le mini RPG is a small project imaginated due to an exercise about OOP in python that was, in my own and humble opinion, way too much easy, so I've created that little project for fun.

The code is still in Frenglish (French-English) but i'll try to transfer everything into English soon.
